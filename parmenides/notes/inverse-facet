		Peter, 

	It has been a long time since I have mailed, but that's usually
good news. The system works smoothly, and I am still enjoying it.

	I have a question about the test in the set-inverse-facet function.
I have problems with two possible values. When I declare a frame to have a
relation with () or another frame (not it's name), I have the message
[* is not a frame though ** has relation *** to it].
	I hacked the function to get rid of the message with ()s but I seem
unable to do the same with actual frames. I guess that the frame making
function (make-frame0 probably) doesn't make the current frame a frame before
calling the set-inverse-facet function.
	Could you tell me how to fix that. I am getting in to heavy compilation
and loading and executing time constraints and all those messages eat up a
lot of time.

	Thanks

			Nick.
