Peter,		Command ISAS did not seem to work in the following function,
**back-track. See trace for more details.

(defun **back-track ()
  (declare (special frame))
  (format t "## **back-track started to be fired ##~%")
    (setq top-frames (isas frame))
    (cond ((eq (get-facet frame 'status 'value) 'I)
           (back-track top-frames))))
;    (let ((top-frames (isas frame)))
;           (format t "## **back-track fired ##~%")

Is this a bug? Or I did not use ISAS in a proper way?

Also, as I said in the previous message, can I use ISAS in a certain way to
only get the ancestor frame(s) at the next top level? Now, I get all ancestor
frames by using (isas frame).

In addition, I expected to only print the frame's name (such as ARCHPLAN,
INPUT, etc.) by using (format t "## Frame ~S processed ##~%" frame) in
function **c-switch.  But in fact I got the whole frame printed out. See also
the trace for details. 

(defun **c-switch ()
  (declare (special frame))
    (let ((out (get-facet frame 'output 'value))
          (new-frames (inverse-isas frame)))
      (cond ((all-P-in out)
	     (format t "## **c-switch fired ##~%")
	     (format t "## Frame ~S processed ##~%" frame)
             (c-switch new-frames)))))             


The following is the trace. I will also send a copy of program ag-simu.lisp to
you. Thanks very much.	    --Guojun
