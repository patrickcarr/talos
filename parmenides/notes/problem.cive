Subject: Parmenides use
Message-ID: <1987.3.24.2.21.45.Fang.Zhao@cive.ri.cmu.edu>

I am now trying to use Parmenides and have encountered a problem.  Guojun
Zhang suggested that I contact you.  My problem is that I couldn't define
any frames after I entered lusid common lisp and loaded "parmenides.vbin".
Lisp kept giving me the error message 

ERROR: #<Package "USER" 3B281B> should be of type SYMBOL

GET:
   Required arg 0 (SYMBOL): #<Package "USER" 3B281B>

   Required arg 1 (INDICATOR): CLASSP
   Optional arg 2 (DEFAULT): NIL
   
I couldn't figure out what's wrong.


The first frame in the file I tried to load is as follows:

(def-frame part-of (is-a relation propagate nil)
  combination-type first
  slot-inherited *ALL*)

I also tried to define the same frame given as an example in the Parmenides
manual (which has a few pages) but got the same error message.  Note in the
above frame I used relation which is a symbol instead a list like (relation)
which is emphasized in the document.

I would appreciate it if you can give me some help on how to fix the problem.
