Thank you. Those two problems are the real serious ones for me.
I just looked at your code for Remove-Frame and I see that its'
behavior is consistent with the code. The problem is a design issue.
You were aware of it in part since you have the comment:

	";;; Should also add frame to a frame freelist"

My problem is that frame names are dynamically created and so long
as the frame exists (as determined by Frame-P) I increment the name.
Thus successive runs on the same data generate different names and that
makes error checking *very* difficult. I can probably try ignoring
Frame-P and trust that I won't screw things up elsewhere. But the
freelist approach doesn't sound too hard to implement. As long as
making a new frame is guaranteed to overwrite *everything*, then
you've only got 4-5 places where the freelist needs to be manipulated.

Handling the Save-Frame problem will let me live longer with the
delete problem (using the above hack).

BTW, ...[:slot :facet] 'symbol ... doesn't work, yet
	..[slot facet] 'symbol ... does!
The former is how the manual describes things, but I can find
no examples of either case in /eg/*.lisp. Neither case works when
the symbol is a number.

set-facet-demons (when FRulekit pre- and post-modify demons fire),
when given a frame and not framename, deletes framename from framename
list and doesn't put it back.
