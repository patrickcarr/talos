The 2gb disk for the CMU AI Repository should be installed by the end of this
week. The purpose of the repository is to contain *all* public domain and freely
distributable software and publications of interest to AI researchers,
educators, and students. Raj is enthusiastic about this endeavor.

I hope you will be willing to include your project's software and publications
in the repository. (The software in question is CMU CL, CMU Simulator
Collection, Garnet, KR, Soar, THEO, FrameKit, Parmenides, Prodigy, eLP, Link
Parser, but if there's anything else appropriate, I'd be happy to include it.)
The repository will be mounted as an AFS disk, so I can set you up with complete
access to a subdirectory of the repository for the "public release"
distribution of your software. The benefit to you, besides inclusion in the
repository and on the CD-ROM, is savings on disk space. With links properly set
up, there will be no visible difference to you. 

The only change is that compressed files will be compressed with 'gzip' instead
of 'compress'. I will take care of the work involved in uncompressing and
gzipping the files. (Gzip is a patent-free compression utility from GNU that
often achieves better results than the LZW algorithm used in 'compress'. Gzip is
installed in CS as /usr/misc/.gnu-others/bin/gzip; the version of zcat in that
directory will work on both compressed and gzipped files. Gzip runs on unix
boxes, IBM PCs, Amigas, and the Apple Macintosh.)

For your information, I've enclosed a copy of the standard permissions letter
below. Sales of the CD-ROM version of the repository will support further growth
of the repository. The price for the CD-ROM is deliberately being kept dirt
cheap to make it accessible to students.

If you have any questions, please send me mail.

Greetings,

Carnegie Mellon University is establishing an Artificial Intelligence
Repository to contain public domain and freely distributable software,
publications, and other materials of interest to AI researchers,
educators, and students. The AI Repository will be accessible by
anonymous FTP and AFS without charge. The contents of the repository
will also be published by Prime Time Freeware as an inexpensive
mixed-media (Book/CD-ROM) publication.

We would like permission to include the following material(s) in the
AI Repository and CD-ROM:


For software materials it would be helpful, though not absolutely
necessary, if you would provide us with a brief description, keywords,
official contact information (names, email/postal addresses, phone
numbers), and any associated mailing lists.

If there are any other materials which you feel would be appropriate
for the repository (e.g., refereed publications, tech reports, theses,
mailing list archives, programs, and other repositories), we would
appreciate hearing about them.

For your information, here is a precis of the CD-ROM:

  PTF for AI is a periodic collection of AI-related source code and
  documentation.  PTF for AI in no way modifies the legal restrictions
  on any package it includes.  The upcoming issue (1-1; Summer, 1993)
  will consist of an ISO-9660 CD-ROM bound into a ~100 page book.  It
  will contain ~600 MB of gzipped archives (2+ GB uncompressed and
  unpacked).  It will sell (list) for $60 US.

Publishing the repository on CD-ROM will make it available to a wider
audience, and provide more convenient access for sites and individuals
who want their own copy of the repository.

Please let us know if we may include your work.  Please inform us, as
well, if there is any reason (cryptography, etc.) why your work may not
be exportable from the US.

Best regards, 

Mark Kantrowitz
Archivist, CMU AI Repository
Editor, PTF for AI
