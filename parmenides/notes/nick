Pete, here are some more details on my problem with relations.
The problem is that the message appears only when creating 
the first instance, but the class creation goes all right.
The other thing is that I don't even define the inherited 
slots or write *ALL* at all.
Last concern would be : what about inverse relations talked
about in framekit.
