Peter,		The files (ag-simu, ag-simu1, ...ag-simu7) are in 
/../nervi/usr/zhang/fr/eg. Since I changed pre-if-set into post-if-set,
set-facet-demons works better but still has problems. I now start the
system (ag-simu.lisp) by typing "(0-1 'INPUT)" where INPUT is a frame.
Two demons (*c-input and *c-output) the frame work, but the third one,
*trigger which is supposed to change facet "switch 0" or "switch 1"
to "switch 1" or "switch 0" for successor frame(s) so far did not work.

Two more questions: (1) Do clear-net and init-rete only work for Fulekit?
I want to know by using which comand(s) we can delete previously loaded
frames. (2) Can we use one demon from one frame to trigger or fire two
or more than two frames at the same time? (of course it cannot be really
parallel.)

Many thanks.	--Guojun
