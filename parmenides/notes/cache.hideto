Subject: Compiling is still a problem
Message-Id: <548471579/tomabech@nl.cs.cmu.edu>

With the compiled version of my memory.lisp (the def-frame file),
add-slot seems to always cache the slot regardless of the value of
:cache as below:

* (pp-frame 'object)
Frame Class OBJECT: (:PROPAGATE T :CACHE (:%CLASS) :IS-A (*GENERIC-PACKAGE*))
NIL
* (add-slot 'object :test '(value 'bogus) :cache nil)
:TEST
* (pp-frame 'object)
Frame Class OBJECT: (:PROPAGATE T :CACHE (:%CLASS :TEST) :IS-A
                     (*GENERIC-PACKAGE*))
TEST            (:VALUE BOGUS :DEPTH 0)
NIL
* 

This does not happen with the uncompiled version of my memory.lisp,
so compiling is still a problem with add-slot.
