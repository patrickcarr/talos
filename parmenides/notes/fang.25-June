Subject: Parmenides problem (such a short peace for you)
Message-ID: <1987.6.25.23.36.35.Fang.Zhao@cive.ri.cmu.edu>

Peter,

I have tried to rescribe my thesis and got some errors concerning math
library use.  I have no idea why it wouldn't scribe corrently now.  I will
figure it out.

At the same time, I have a problem with Parmenides and need
your help.  I changed some of my frame slots from facetless to having facets
so that I could remember the units I used.  However, I seemed to have
touched a nerve of Parmenides and frames won't load now.  The script is as
follows.  Last time, frame 'column' was loaded before 'beam' and the error
occurred to 'beam'.  This time I switched them and error occurred to
'column'.  The frames are in /../fzhao/hi-rise/def-1.lisp.  Thanks.

A question: if I define a frame as
(def-frame example ()
  :weight (value 0 units 'Ib))

and a local variable W is 100.  How should I make a new example with weight
slot value facet to be the value of W?
(make-example 'ex-1 :weight ('value W))  ?
