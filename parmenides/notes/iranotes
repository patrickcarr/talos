Subject: FORK doc and sys

I read the document and have a number of comments.  Most of them should be
discussed.  I'll be back at CMU around 3pm.  I might be able to read my mail
over there.  Here are some of the comments.  

1. The FORK manual should be part of the Rulekit manual.

2. Suggestion: Move section 3. to right after the first paragraph of the
Introduction.  Make it section 2.  Make what was section 2, section 3.  And
make the rest of the Introduction section 4 - call it Design Decisions or
whatever you like.  Finally make what was section 4, section 5.  I'll
explain why when I see you.

3. Suppose I want to define a general procedure to display the frame classes
written in FORK; it's not clear how this could be done in terms of the
commands you document.  For one there should be a command to get slot names
of a given frame, which as far as I can tell there isn't.  There is such a
command in FrameKit and CRL.

4. Can inverse relations on any slots be created?  I found this quite useful.

5. Does def-frame always make a default instance of a frame class.  Can this
be turned off?  In some uses of semantic nets instances are only needed when
a class or in this case a concept is recognized as having something falling
under it; then an instance is created.

6. I have other comments about: style, typos, gaps etc. which we can discuss
later today.


Some of your design decisions were quite interesting to me, and I'd like to
discuss these further as well.

Ira
