Peter,

I tried again and met the same proble with the inverse relation.  You loaded
my frame file successfully because I commented out the inverse relation
"has" last night to see if it was the problem and forgot to change it back.
Sorry for that.  The frame definitions are in /../usr/fzhao/hi-rise/def.lisp
and I have put "has" in.  The other problem is gone.  Thanks.  --Fang
