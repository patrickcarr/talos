Subject: Parmenides question
Cc: Edward.Kenschaft@NL.CS.CMU.EDU

     I've been playing around with Parmenides for use with the
Diogenes project (under Sergei Nirenburg).  For our purposes,
I need to find a way, given a frame name, to return a list of
that frame's slots and their values (no facets).  Is there some
easy way of doing this?  I'm trying a hack with vector-pop used
with the frame and get-slot-names commands, but it would be nice
if there were something a bit more elegant.

     Thanks.

P.S. Oh, by the way, frame-p is a useful function to have around.
Until I came across it by accident in your code, I was about to
design my own, since I didn't see any mention of it in the
documentation.  Also, in Section 3.1.4. of the documentation,
the value for consumes should not be quoted.  At least, that's
how I got facet-less values to work.
