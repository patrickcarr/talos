Klaus, here are the functions I've written, I still haven't compiled on the
RT:

get-facet, get-name-facet, get-instance-facet
get-value, get-name-value, get-instance-value
get-slot, get-name-slot, get-instance-slot

set-facet, set-name-facet, set-instance-facet
set-value, set-name-value, set-instance-value
set-slot, set-name-slot, set-instance-slot

set-facet-demons (actually takes a name)

I still need to write set-name-facet-demons and set-instance-facet-demons.
I've tested most of them.

(pp-wm) should be done in a few minutes.  Tell me if you want me to
re-compile the new parm on the RT.
(I'm leaving at 6)
