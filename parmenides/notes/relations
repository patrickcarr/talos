The frameless manual is all we need for the Navy.
  
I like the idea of the inhereted & user define relations,
 however, I don't know if only "isa" as hardwired will do.  How
do you define inheritance in 'part-of' (the part inherits the "made-from",
"location", etc slots from the whole, but not the "function", "size",
"name", etc slots), or 'close-to' which is transitive for only a few steps
(as opposed to isa & part of that are arbitrarily often transitive).
