Peter,

I am in trouble again.  I have changed 'is-part-of' to have facet (see
/../ce/usr/fzhao/hi-rise/def-1.lisp) and when a new frame was created and
slot 'is-part-of' was filled, something went wrong.  I copied a part of the
code and the script below.  Could you have a look?  What puzzled me is that
I tried my test.lisp (handle is part of door, and door of truck) which is
written exactly the same way as my program and everything was fine.  I am
pretty sure that the problem is 'is-part-of' because it worked before when
it was facetless and I didn't change anything except 'is-part-of' (though I
am not using inverse relation 'has' now, I need the value of 'is-part-of' to
be a list).  By the way, if an instance is part of two instances of aother
class, and inheritance-type is *ALL*, how will the information to be
inherited?  Would that be a problem?  -Fang
