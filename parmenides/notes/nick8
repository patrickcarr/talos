Pete, 

I think the machines refuse to talk together. I therefore 
try this address. Tell me if you receive anything. 

Here are my last mails.

		Hi Pete,

	I didn't receive any answer from you to my last couple of 
mails. I hope nothing's wrong. Hopwever, if you didn't receive them, 
I can always send you a copy. Just let me know.

	Right now, I've got an interesting bug. When I redefine the 
same class twice in a row, giving it different parents, the second 
class defined gets the cons of the previous and the given parents.

> (def-frame bidon ())
Re-defining class BIDON
;;; Warning: Redefining MAKE-BIDON
BIDON
> (isas 'bidon)
NIL
> (def-frame bidon (is-a (node)))
Re-defining class BIDON
;;; Warning: Redefining MAKE-BIDON
BIDON
> (isas 'bidon)
(NODE)
> (def-frame bidon (is-a (level)))
Re-defining class BIDON
;;; Warning: Redefining MAKE-BIDON
BIDON
> (isas 'bidon)
(NODE LEVEL)

	Do you observe such behavior or did I do something wrong ? 

	Thanks for answering.

Pete, I have a strange behavior in inherited slots. Here is the code.

(setq node
      (frame
       (def-frame node (cache *ALL*)
  linked-to-root (value *DEFAULT*)
  components (value *DEFAULT*)
  parent (value *DEFAULT*)
  x (value *DEFAULT* changeable t)
  y (value *DEFAULT* changeable t)
  space (value *DEFAULT* changeable t))))

(setq building
      (frame
       (def-frame building (is-a (node))
  name (value "building" changeable t)
  has-parts (value *DEFAULT*))))

(set-value building 'components 'grid)

Re-defining class NODE
;;; Warning: Redefining MAKE-NODE
Re-defining class BUILDING
;;; Warning: Redefining MAKE-BUILDING

;when I load the file, I cannot make any more subclasses of node
;this is because the slot plist has been modified by the call to
;set-value (see the @@@GRID@@@, I added the @@@ of course)

(symbol-plist 'node)

(INSTANCE-NAMES (ROOT) INVERSE-ISAS (BIDON 3D-LATERAL-2 3D-LATERAL-1 3D-GRAVITY-MATERIAL 3D-LATERAL-MATERIAL IMAGINARY-LOAD GRAVITY-LOAD LATERAL-LOAD GRID BUILDING LEVEL) ISAS NIL :FRAME #<Vector T 7 CA8263> INSTANCES (#<Vector T 7 CA8263>) CLASSP T :FRAME-TYPE Frame NODE:
Slots: (%CLASS NODE LINKED-TO-ROOT (VALUE *DEFAULT* DEPTH 1) COMPONENTS (VALUE @@@GRID@@@ DEPTH 0) PARENT (VALUE *DEFAULT* DEPTH 1) X (VALUE *DEFAULT* DEPTH 1 CHANGEABLE T) Y (VALUE *DEFAULT* DEPTH 1 CHANGEABLE T) SPACE (VALUE *DEFAULT* DEPTH 1 CHANGEABLE T))

;the only patch I could find for this limited situation is 

(set-value node 'components '*DEFAULT*)

;but that can only work in limited cases

What do you think is going wrong ?

I hope you don't mind my bothering you twice in a day.

	Pete, I couldn't get in touch with the second machine 
either. 
	I know it's going to take you some time, but could you 
please send me the corresponding files and documemntation through 
the E-mail ?
	Last thing, how could I get a hand at class slots, like 
cache and everything ?

	Thanks for keeping me aware of the new release.
