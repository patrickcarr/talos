Message-Id: <546746367/iam@nl.cs.cmu.edu>

After loading this on top of stan.prm, I can't load anything else.

(DEF-FRAME information-constituent (is-a (mental-object)))
	(DEF-FRAME character (is-a (information-constituent)))
	(DEF-FRAME number (is-a (information-constituent)))
	(DEF-FRAME comp-struct (is-a (information-constituent)))
	;;
	(DEF-FRAME string (is-a (comp-struct)))
	(DEF-FRAME vector (is-a (comp-struct)))
	(DEF-FRAME symbol (is-a (comp-struct)))
	(DEF-FRAME array (is-a (comp-struct)))

Of course when I add suffixes to all the lispy terms it loads just
fine.  I'm not sure which of them is the culprit.
