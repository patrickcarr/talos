		Peter, 

	I tried the new version of Parmenides. I first tested 
the inverse relations between instances. It unfortunately didn't 
work. Here is the code and session. Note that Parmenides doesn't 
tell you anymore about the creation of the components slot. 

----------------------------------------------------------
(def-frame parent (is-a relation)
  has-inverses t
  inverse-name components)

(setq a
      (frame
       (def-frame a ()
  components (value ()))))

(setq a1
      (make-frame 'a 'a1))

(setq b
      (frame
       (def-frame b ()
  parent (value ()))))

(setq b1
      (make-frame 'b 'b1
                  :parent `(value ,a1)))

(defun ppp (x)
  (pp-frame x)
  (terpri))

(ppp a)
(ppp a1)
(ppp b)
(ppp b1)

I must have done something wrong or even picked-up the wrong 
files from ml. Tell me what you can find out.
