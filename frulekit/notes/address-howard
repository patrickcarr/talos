Subject: Parmenides Lisp Session


	Below is a recording of the lisp session that you asked for. I used
the script command, and I have placed extra comments, prefaced by '---',
in the script for clarity.

	The commands that I entered while in the lisp session are prefaced
by the '>' sign. The output from the session are prefaced by the ';;;'
notation.

	The error that I got this time was not the same as what I got
before, leading me to believe that I may be doing something wrong.

	I would appreciate it if you would send the reference manual.
It could be sent to:
	Roger R. Harper
	Department of Systems and Computer Science
	School of Engineering, Howard University
	2300 6th. St. N.W.
	Washington D.C. 20059

				Thanks for your assistance.
