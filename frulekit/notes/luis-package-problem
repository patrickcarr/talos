Pete:

Finally, thanks  to   your  help,  the  parmenides.lisp file was
compiled and writed as  parmenides.sparcl. After that, we loaded
the  build.lisp file  of  frulekit  and   compiled   it  without
problem. But  when  we   tried to  load  the inter.lisp  file of
frulekit ...



USER(8): (load "/usr2/cresus/frulekit/inter.lisp")
(load "/usr2/cresus/frulekit/inter.lisp")
;   Loading /usr2/cresus/frulekit/inter.lisp.
Error: Exporting the symbol LITERALIZE from the `FRULEKIT' package would cause
       some packages that use the `FRULEKIT' package to have two accessible
       but distinct symbols with the same print name.  The packages and
       conflicting symbols are:
        package `COMMON-LISP-USER':  COMMON-LISP-USER::LITERALIZE

  [condition type: PACKAGE-ERROR]

Restart actions (select using :continue):
 0: Unintern conflicting symbols
 1: Skip exporting the symbols
 2: retry the load of /usr2/cresus/frulekit/inter.lisp
 3: Try calling COMMON-LISP-USER::LITERALIZE again
 4: Return a value
 5: Try calling a different function
 6: Setf the symbol function of COMMON-LISP-USER::LITERALIZE and call it again
 7: retry the load of /usr2/cresus/comercial/dataman/dataman-frames

The value for the optimization settings are
safety   2
speed    2
debug    2

The others variables have the NIL value in the .clinit.cl file


What could it have happened ?

Regards a lot.
