Subject: Using Frulekit
Cc: rrh@scsla.howard.edu

Hello,
	My name is Roger Harper, I work with Dr. Coleman at Howard University.
I spoke to you in December about downloading Frulekit. I was able to download 
the source, from nl.cs.cmu.edu, as directed, but I am having a little problem 
compiling it. As directed, I downloaded the files build.lisp, inter.lisp, 
fr-messages.eng, parmenides.lisp, and pa-messages.eng. I follow the directions 
for compiling FRulekit as given in the FRulekit manual, I was able to load the 
file parmenides.lisp, but when I try to execute the compile-file operation, 
the compiler aborts with the error message:
       >>Error: faslout saw object of unknown type NIL
This happens when the compiler tries to write the binary output.

	Would this be related to my not having the file 'parmenides.fasl' that 
was mentioned in the manual, or is it a problem with the lisp compiler that I
am using? I am using HP Common Lisp 4.0 which is supposed to be compatible 
with Common Lisp. Could it be that FRulekit was not designed to work with this
dialect of Common Lisp?

	Also, is there a reference manual for CMU Lisp available, and would
it be possible for me to receive a copy? I feel that with a manual, I may
be able to see the differences between CMU Lisp and HP Lisp and may be able to
better understand what is going on.

	Any help that you can provide will be appreciated.

			Thanks,
			Roger R. Harper rrh@scsla.howard.edu
