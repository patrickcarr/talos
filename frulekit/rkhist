The history and status of FRulekit:

Framekit was originally written by Jaime Carbonell in Franz lisp around
1984. Framekit is based on SRL, a schema representation language written
by Mark Fox in the CMU Robotics Institute.  Robert Joseph Framekit to
Commonlisp and added some enhancements.  He is the maintainer of Framekit.

Carbonell wrote an agenda system called Rulekit in Franz lisp in 1985.
I translated this to Common lisp.  Then I wrote a full production system
with a Rete net and working memory, still calling it Rulekit.  Then I wrote
FRulekit, which is (my) Rulekit with frames as working-memory elements.  It
uses the Agenda module as an alternative to the standard conflict-resolution
strategies.

The frame system that FRulekit uses is called Parmenides, which has some
functionality in common with Framekit, but is enhanced and tailored for the
needs of FRulekit.  I also wrote and support Parmenides.
